## About
This repository hosts 30+ Python projects that are solved and explained in detail. Each project is designed to be:
- **Practical**: solves a real-world problem or implements a commonly requested feature.
- **Educational**: includes explanations, comments, and notes to help you understand design choices.
- **Portable**: uses standard Python and common third-party packages; instructions for creating virtual environments and installing dependencies are provided.

_Use this repo to learn, fork for your portfolio, or adapt solutions for your own projects._

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip
- Recommended: virtualenv or venv
- OS: cross-platform (Windows / macOS / Linux)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARUNAGIRINATHAN-K/Python-Projects-For-Beginners-and-Advanced-Level.git
cd REPO_NAME
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install global requirements (if present):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_Note: Some projects have individual `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` files inside their folders â€” check each project folder for precise dependencies._

### Quick Start
Open any project folder and follow the README inside that folder. Example (for the Web Scraper project):
```bash
cd web-scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scraper.py --url "https://example.com" --output results.json
```

## Usage Examples
Below are a few usage snippets for representative projects:

- Calculator CLI
```bash
cd calculator
python calc.py "2 + 3 * (4 - 1)"
# Output: 11
```

- Flask REST API
```bash
cd flask-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
# Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/items
```

- Tic-Tac-Toe (with AI)
```bash
cd tic-tac-toe
python play.py --mode ai
```

(For exact arguments and more options, see each project's README.)

## Testing
Where included, tests can be run using pytest:
```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```
Or run tests per project:
```bash
cd some-project
pytest
```
CI workflows (if added) will run tests automatically on pushes and pull requests.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make changes, add tests, and update docs.
4. Run tests and linters.
5. Commit and push your branch.
6. Open a Pull Request describing your changes.

Guidelines:
- Write clear commit messages.
- Keep each PR focused.
- Add or update project README where relevant.
- Respect the existing code style. Consider adding a `pyproject.toml` or `.flake8` for consistent linting.

## Recommended Badges (replace USERNAME/REPO_NAME)
- Build / CI: add your GitHub Actions, Travis, or CircleCI badge
- Coverage: if you use Codecov or Coveralls
- Docs: if you host docs (GitHub Pages / ReadTheDocs)
